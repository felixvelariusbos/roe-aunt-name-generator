LEARN YOUR ROE AUNT NAME

DON'T YOU WANT TO LEARN YOUR NAME IF YOU WERE A ROE AUNT. DON'T YOU WANT TO **BE** A ROE AUNT.

OF COURSE YOU DO.

RUN `python aunt_namer.py` TO GET A RANDOM ROE NAME

RUNNNING WITHOUT PARAMETERS WILL CHOOSE A RANDOM STATE/PROVINCE/TERRITORY/COUNTRY AND THEN A RANDOM ANIMAL.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESTRICT THE ANIMAL NAME TO SOMETHING STARTING WITH THE SAME LETTER AS YOUR NAME, ADD A SINGLE CHARACTER AS A PARAMTER FOR EXAMPLE `python aunt_namer.py a`

(YOU MAY HAVE TO `pip install requirements.txt` first)

I HAVE AREAS FROM 
- USA
- UK
- Canada
- Mexico
- Italy
- Australia

ALL SCRAPED FROM WIKIPEDIA. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD MORE, ADD SOME LINES TO THE `data/places.txt` FILE. OR LIKE PUT IN AN ISSUE REQUEST AND I'LL ADD A BUNCH.

IF THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, ADD TO THE `data/animals.txt` FILE

MAYBE ONE DAY I WILL MAKE THIS INTO A NICE WEBBY INTERFACE. BUT TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY

THANK YOU TO THE OG ARIZONA FOR HAVING A GREAT NAME
